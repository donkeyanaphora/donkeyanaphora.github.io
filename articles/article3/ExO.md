## üé≠ Extra-Ordinary Language

I've been thinking a lot about a chat I had with a former colleague about language that breaks semantic expectations. The conversation then veered into causal language models and their various generation parameters like temperature. What interests me in particular is unexpected or anomalous usage with clear intention where semantic violations in the form of absurdities or paradoxes are packed with metaphysical depth.

In this post, I'm dog-earing these thoughts to revisit later.  
The aim here is to examine the specific forms these expressions take and explore how we might capture their tension and their coherence in a computational framework.

### Literary Examples

> So they lov'd, as love in twain  
> Had the essence but in one;  
> Two distincts, division none:  
> Number there in love was slain.  
>   
> Hearts remote, yet not asunder;  
> Distance and no space was seen  
> Twixt this Turtle and his queen  
>   
> ‚Äî *Shakespeare, **The Phoenix and the Turtle***

> A cage went in search of a bird.  
>   
> ‚Äî *Kafka, **Aphorisms***

> Merry and tragical! Tedious and brief!  
> That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.  
> How shall we find the concord of this discord?  
>   
> ‚Äî *Shakespeare, **A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream***

### Pseudo-Formalizations

Because of their intentionality and depth I'm going to call these violations of ‚Äúordinary use‚Äù **extra-ordinary use** (a bit gimmicky).  
They don't obscure meaning but instead elucidate by way of contradiction or a violation of expectations. Now the question is: **how to formalize them?**

| Passage | Logical sketch | English |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| *‚ÄúTwo distincts, division none‚Äù* | $\Box_{\,\mathrm{p}}\,\text{Distinct}(a,b) \;\land\; \Box_{\,\mathrm{m}}\,\lnot\text{Distinct}(a,b)$ | $\text{Bodies: two + Souls: one}$ |
| *‚ÄúHearts remote, yet not asunder‚Äù* | $\Box_{\,\mathrm{p}}\,\text{Remote}(a,b) \;\land\; \Box_{\,\mathrm{m}}\,\lnot\text{Remote}(a,b)$ | $\text{Spatially apart + Spiritually united}$ |
| *‚ÄúHot ice / wondrous strange snow‚Äù*[^1] | $\Box_{\,\mathrm{p}}\,\lnot(\text{Ice}\land\text{Hot}) \;\land\; \Diamond_{\,\mathrm{m}}\,(\text{Ice}\land\text{Hot})$ | $\text{Physically impossible ‚Üí imaginatively possible}$ |
| *‚ÄúA cage went in search of a bird‚Äù* | $\text{Search}(e,\text{cage},\text{bird}) \;\land\; \text{ReqAnim}(\text{cage}) \;\land\; \lnot\text{Animate}(\text{cage}) \;\vdash\; \bot$<br><br>$\text{allegory} \;\to\; \text{Search}(e,\text{oppression},\text{freedom})$ | $\text{Oppression pursues freedom}$ |


It seems like these literary devices can be described as any utterance whose **literal semantic model fails in the physical world yet remains interpretable (and often profound) once we flip modality, type, or world-knowledge layer.**

ExO($\varphi$) $\;\equiv\;$ MC($\varphi$) $\;\lor\;$ MP($\varphi$) $\;\lor\;$ TC($\varphi$)

where  

* **MC(œï)** $:= \Box_{\,\mathrm{p}}\,œï \;\land\; \Box_{\,\mathrm{m}}\,\lnot œï$ ‚Äî *Modal Contradiction*  
* **MP(œï)** $:= \Box_{\,\mathrm{p}}\,\lnot œï \;\land\; \Diamond_{\,\mathrm{m}}\,œï$ ‚Äî *Modal Projection*  
* **TC(œï)** $:= (\,œï \land \text{Presup}(œï)\,) \;\vdash\; \bot$ ‚Äî *Type Clash*

$\Box$, $\Diamond$ ‚Äî necessity / possibility  
$\Box_{\,\mathrm{p}}$, $\Diamond_{\,\mathrm{p}}$ ‚Äî physical-world modality  
$\Box_{\,\mathrm{m}}$, $\Diamond_{\,\mathrm{m}}$ ‚Äî metaphysical / allegorical modality


### Some Probabilistic Approaches

Here as some resources on controllable generation these could offer a good starting point in terms of guiding models to emulate instances or traces of extra-ordinary language, but I think to truly address this task there will be a need to address deeper epistemic questions, questions about creativity, novelty, fluid intelligence, and in machine learning terms adaptive generalization to out of distribution tasks (hence the Francois Chollet paper).

### Open Problems

1. **Refinement:** Can we formally bound the space of ExO language? Our current modal framework offers a logical sketch but most likely lacks sufficient coverage or the rigidity needed for identification, representation and evaluation. We need clearer boundaries: When does poetic contradiction become noise and what is the true scope of these instances of linguistic novelty. 

2. **Epistemic Requirements:** What cognitive capacities underlie ExO understanding and can models develop analogues of them and critically, will this require efforts that extend beyond emulation and pattern matching, toward fluid intelligence, e.g. adaptive generalization to out of distribution tasks. Additionally, what role does ExO language play in the broader arc of intelligence? Could it serve as a diagnostic for flexible reasoning or abstract linguistic intelligence?

3. **Evaluation:** Can we develop metrics that reward semantic dissonance under control e.g. language that violates expectations but remains interpretable and meaningful? Effective evaluation depends on a rigorous definition of ExO. Without clearly defined formal properties semantic, modal, etc we cannot design benchmarks that identify interpretive tension, modality shifts, or allegorical coherence as measurable features. 

4. **Generation Control:** How do we tune a model along an anomaly-coherence axis and in a more critical sense can we capture the generative faculty behind ExO language?


### Closing Thoughts

It's hard not to think of Wittgenstein's elucidation of private pain or propositions like  
‚Äúwhat can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.‚Äù  
Hand-wavey metaphysical insights aside, maybe we can define these extra-ordinary utterances in purely distributional terms.  
The J. L. Austin brute-force approach: **want to understand a linguistic phenomenon? Read through countless examples and then formalize.**

Ultimately, the hope is to improve generation so we can guide it toward extra-ordinary usage, language that is *‚Äúwondrous strange snow.‚Äù*

      The oxymoron stays physically impossible, but the new name lets the audience picture it for a moment as an imaginable marvel.  
      I think this imaginative license would still make it a Modal-Projection (MP).*
