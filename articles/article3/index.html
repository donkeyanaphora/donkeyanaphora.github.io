      <h2 id="extra-ordinary-language">🎭 Extra-Ordinary Language</h2>
      <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about a chat I had with a former
      colleague about language that breaks semantic expectations. The
      conversation then veered into causal language models and their
      various generation parameters like temperature. What interests me
      in particular is unexpected or anomalous usage with clear
      intention where semantic violations in the form of absurdities or
      paradoxes are packed with metaphysical depth.</p>
      <p>In this post, I’m dog-earing these thoughts to revisit
      later.<br />
      The aim here is to examine the specific forms these expressions
      take and explore how we might capture their tension and their
      coherence in a computational framework.</p>

      <p>Because of their intentionality and depth I’m going to call
      these violations of “ordinary use” <strong>extra-ordinary
      use</strong> (a bit gimmicky).<br />
      They don’t obscure meaning but instead elucidate by way of
      contradiction or a violation of expectations. Now the question is:
      <strong>how to formalize them?</strong></p>

      utterance whose <strong>literal semantic model fails in the

      <p>Here as some resources on controllable generation these could
      offer a good starting point in terms of guiding models to emulate
      instances or traces of extra-ordinary language, but I think to
      truly address this task there will be a need to address deeper
      epistemic questions, questions about creativity, novelty, fluid
      intelligence, and in machine learning terms adaptive
      generalization to out of distribution tasks (hence the Francois
      Chollet paper).</p>

      <!-- 1. **Representation.** How do we encode the “anomalous-yet-coherent” instances that mark ExO language? 
      2. **Evaluation.** What rubric separates these contradictions from plain nonsense and where is the cutoff?  
      3. **Generation control.** Beyond temperature, how do we tune a model along an anomaly-coherence axis and in a more critical sense can we capture the generative faculty behind ExO language?   -->
      <ol type="1">
      <li><p><strong>Refinement:</strong> Can we formally bound the
      space of ExO language? Our current modal framework offers a
      logical sketch but most likely lacks sufficient coverage or the
      rigidity needed for identification, representation and evaluation.
      We need clearer boundaries: When does poetic contradiction become
      noise and what is the true scope of these instances of linguistic
      novelty.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Epistemic Requirements:</strong> What cognitive
      capacities underlie ExO understanding and can models develop
      analogues of them and critically, will this require efforts that
      extend beyond emulation and pattern matching, toward fluid
      intelligence, e.g. adaptive generalization to out of distribution
      tasks. Additionally, what role does ExO language play in the
      broader arc of intelligence? Could it serve as a diagnostic for
      flexible reasoning or abstract linguistic intelligence?</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Can we develop metrics that
      reward semantic dissonance under control e.g. language that
      violates expectations but remains interpretable and meaningful?
      Effective evaluation depends on a rigorous definition of ExO.
      Without clearly defined formal properties semantic, modal, etc we
      cannot design benchmarks that identify interpretive tension,
      modality shifts, or allegorical coherence as measurable
      features.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Generation Control:</strong> How do we tune a model
      along an anomaly-coherence axis and in a more critical sense can
      we capture the generative faculty behind ExO language?</p></li>

      <h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
      <p>It’s hard not to think of Wittgenstein’s elucidation of private
      pain or propositions like<br />
      “what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot
      talk about we must pass over in silence.”<br />
      Hand-wavey metaphysical insights aside, maybe we can define these
      extra-ordinary utterances in purely distributional terms.<br />
      The J. L. Austin brute-force approach: <strong>want to understand
      a linguistic phenomenon? Read through countless examples and then
      formalize.</strong></p>
      <p>Ultimately, the hope is to improve generation so we can guide
      it toward extra-ordinary usage, language that is <em>“wondrous
      strange snow.”</em></p>
