      <p><strong>COLLINS WESTNEDGE</strong><br />
      <em>JULY 2, 2025</em></p>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>I’ve been thinking about a conversation I had with a former
      colleague about language that defies ordinary usage. More
      specifically expressions that violate the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics">distributional
      hypothesis</a> of language and yet carry high degrees of
      intentionality and depth.</p>
      <p>When Kafka wrote “A cage went in search of a bird,” he created
      something that on the surface seems impossible and yet expresses a
      profound and insidious truth. Current AI systems, for all their
      linguistic sophistication, rarely produce such language. They
      excel at coherent, informative prose but struggle with the kind of
      intentional violations that define great literature.</p>
      <p>In this post, I’m dog-earing these thoughts to revisit later.
      The aim here is to understand what makes these expressions work
      and more critically, the implications this has on how we measure
      and evaluate model intelligence.</p>
      <!-- Along the way, I'll attempt some preliminary formalizations and speculate about why current AI systems struggle with this capacity. -->

      <h3 id="core-characteristics">Core Characteristics</h3>
      <p>Because of their intentionality and depth I’m going to call
      these violations of “ordinary use” <strong>extra-ordinary
      use</strong> or <strong>ExO language</strong>. They don’t obscure
      meaning but instead elucidate by way of contradiction or a
      violation of expectations.</p>
      <p>These literary examples share a unifying feature: they present
      a <strong>literal semantic failure</strong> in one domain that
      creates insightful or profound resonance in another domain
      (metaphorical, allegorical, or abstract).</p>
      <p>As DFW said “we all know there’s no quicker way to empty a joke
      of its particular magic than to explain it” and the same is true
      for figurative language. However, at the risk of literary
      blasphemy here is one way to illustrate the ways in which these
      expressions <em>may</em> resolve through a figurative
      interpretation:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>“Two distincts, division none” - two bodies, one soul</li>
      <li>“A cage went in search of a bird” - oppression seeks
      freedom</li>
      <li>“I can’t go on, I’ll go on” - continuation is not a choice,
      it’s compulsory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each case, the reader encounters a jarring violation of
      expectation that is only resolved through a figurative
      reinterpretation:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>⟦φ⟧<sub>lit</sub> = ⊥ ; ⟦φ⟧<sub>fig</sub> = ψ.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here, ⟦φ⟧ denotes the interpretation of expression φ, ⊥
      indicates contradiction, and ψ the emergent or resolved
      meaning.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, these examples illustrate how expressions can
      fracture under a literal reading yet resolve in an imaginative
      one. Making that fracture or violation explicit clarifies how
      objectives rooted in the distributional hypothesis e.g. next-token
      prediction or RLHF tuned for coherence and readability could steer
      models away from ExO language. If we want systems that embrace
      deliberate, meaningful rule-bending, we’ll need benchmarks that
      more actively reward it.</p>
      <h2 id="why-might-current-ai-struggle-here">Why Might Current AI
      Struggle Here?</h2>
      <p>Current language models face several systematic barriers to
      producing ExO language; at this point many of these are my own
      thoughts or fan theory rather than concrete fact, but nevertheless
      here they are:</p>
      <p><strong>Data Scarcity in Pretraining</strong>: Though profound
      literature exists in pretraining corpora (Google Books, etc.),
      it’s statistically underrepresented. By definition, novel writing
      is rare, and easily-licensed conventional text dominates the
      training mix. Even within Pulitzer Prize winning articles/books
      etc the instances of truly profound prose/ExO language (as
      impactful as they may be) are few and far between.</p>
      <p><strong>Objective Mismatch</strong>: From a causal language
      modeling perspective, next token prediction is less about encoding
      the abstract concepts or deep intentionality these examples are
      made up of and more so about emulation of style and prose. At this
      phase models learn to reproduce surface features without encoding
      the abstract concepts that necessarily drive literary innovation.
      Even though large causal models like GPT-3 begin to exhibit some
      few-shot behavior with sufficient examples, it seems unlikely that
      the causal training paradigm alone gets us the abstract
      associative power necessary for truly novel language.</p>
      <p><strong>Task Absence During Fine-tuning</strong>: When models
      are optimized for instruction following, there’s likely an absence
      of tasks that push them to not just learn ExO behavior, but more
      importantly exhibit it. The training emphasizes practical
      capabilities over creative linguistic reasoning. Though literary
      analysis and reading comprehension are a big part of this phase
      they are somewhat distinct from the task of exhibiting and
      producing novel prose. In short, there are more analyses of great
      works than great works, and the reading comprehension/literary
      analysis task itself aligns more intuitively with how we quantify
      intelligence in school.</p>
      <p><strong>RLHF Optimization Pressure</strong>: This one is fun to
      think about. From a preference learning perspective, I doubt
      anyone wants to do full-blown Harold Bloom literary analysis to
      rate model outputs. Most annotators would favor accessible,
      Wikipedia-style entries over Joycean explorations of any topic.
      This optimization pressure likely eliminates whatever literary
      capabilities emerge during pretraining. There are also many
      studies that suggest RLHF can reduce a model’s output diversity,
      which can be found in the key readings section further down.</p>
      <p>Studies indicate RLHF improves generalization on benchmark
      tasks at the cost of reduced output diversity, suggesting a
      tradeoff between the two. The interesting case is what happens
      within the set of valid solutions. For tasks that admit many
      correct answers, does RLHF collapse probability mass onto a narrow
      set of conventional solutions? If so, this would work directly
      against fluid intelligence, which, following Chollet, should
      exhibit uniform probability across equally valid outputs while
      suppressing invalid ones. ExO language is precisely the kind of
      output that’s valid but unconventional: high on the “correct but
      rare” end of the distribution, and thus vulnerable to being
      optimized away.</p>
      <p><strong>The Deeper Issue: Fluid Literary Intelligence</strong>:
      The more I examine instances of impactful prose packed with
      intentionality and metaphysical depth, the more convinced I am
      that modeling such language requires what could be called fluid
      literary intelligence. This goes beyond pattern matching toward
      adaptive generalization on out-of-distribution linguistic tasks.
      An ability to traverse distant conceptual pathways, pathways that
      have not surfaced during pretraining. This likely overlaps with
      the intuition that scaling up inference time compute improves
      reasoning models by allowing them to perform a more exhaustive
      grid search of the solution space. However, as far as I can tell
      this strategy mostly applies to verifiable tasks and thus creative
      analogical reasoning in a literary or ExO capacity may remain a
      blindspot.</p>
      <p>In short, ExO language appears to depend on advanced, or at
      least highly creative, analogical reasoning. Its defining feature
      is the construction of meaningful and unexpected connections
      between disparate, and often seemingly contradictory, concepts,
      connections that resist literal validation but nonetheless produce
      insight.</p>
      <p><strong>Missing Benchmarks</strong>: This leads to deeper
      questions: What constitutes literary novelty computationally? Why
      are there no benchmarks on par with ARC that touch this axis of
      intelligence? Current reasoning evaluation has heavily favored
      verifiable tasks (coding, math) over creative reasoning.</p>

      <h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p><strong>Sociological Influence</strong>: How do we account for
      the way social and historical contexts shape judgements of novelty
      and creativity and is it a moving target?</p>
      <p>Novelty and creativity are often historically and socially
      situated. A good deal of what constitutes creativity and novelty
      is dependent on the historical context in which artistic
      expressions are judged. Citizen Kane, for example, is often cited
      as one of the greatest films of all time due to its innovative
      cinematography and storytelling. However, the cinematic
      innovations that define this film, such as Toland’s use of depth
      of field, is now a staple in most introductory film courses.
      Fashion often follows a similar arc, innovative and fresh designs
      that mark the runway one season saturate the shelves of
      fast-fashion retailers the next.</p>
      <p>Though judgements about creativity and artistic merit are
      heavily influenced by the social and historical factors there is
      still a sense in which great works are able to stand the test of
      time. When evaluating creative intelligence, we must consider how
      social and historical contexts shape our aesthetic judgements and
      distinguish between those that are fleeting and those that
      endure.</p>
      <p>Just because models can exhibit surprisal or violate semantic
      expectations doesn’t always mean they possess the ability to do so
      meaningfully. Ultimately, the goal is to understand whether
      machines can develop the kind of flexible, creative intelligence
      that ExO language represents—and to build evaluation frameworks
      that recognize this intelligence when it emerges. In short, we
      need benchmarks that reward “wondrous strange snow.”</p>
