      <p>I‚Äôve been revisiting a conversation with a former colleague
      about language that deliberately flies in the face of ordinary
      usage e.g.¬†expressions that violate the statistical expectations
      of language itself and yet still carry high degrees of
      intentionality and philosophical weight. Expressions like ‚ÄúA cage
      went in search of a bird‚Äù epitomizes this and when Kafka wrote
      this, he created something that contemporary AI rarely produces, a
      semantic impossibility that somehow makes perfect sense.</p>
      <!-- I call this phenomenon **extra-ordinary language**. -->
      <p>In this post, I‚Äôm dog-earing these thoughts to revisit later.
      The aim here is to understand what makes these expressions work,
      and understand how they maintain coherence through contradiction
      or linguistic violation and more critically, why this matters for
      how we think about intelligence. Along the way, I‚Äôll attempt some
      preliminary formalizations and speculate about why current AI
      systems struggle with this capacity.</p>
      <!-- In this post, I'm dog-earing these thoughts to revisit later. The aim here is to examine these linguistic anomalies more closely and ask a question that's been nagging at me: if this type of expression represents a distinct form of intelligence, why don't we have any benchmarks for it? -->

      They don‚Äôt obscure meaning but instead elucidate by way of

      can we formalize some of them and what does it say about what
      makes these instances special?</p>

      <p>This is more of a fan theory at this point but it feels like
      examples of profound language may have surfaced in the models
      pretraining google books though by definition of novel writing it
      is likely under represented, additionally from a causal language
      model base training perspective this is less about encoding the
      abstract concepts or deep intentionality these examples are made
      up of and more so about emulation of style and prose at this point
      in the training. Sure larger models like GPT-3 especially with
      sufficient examples of this type of text may begin to exhibit some
      few shot behavior or ability to encode more abstract concepts
      about this sort of language, but overall I would be surprised if
      the casual base training paradigm gets us the level of reasoning
      and intelligence necessary to truly exhibit novel prose.</p>
      <p>As the models are further optimized on higher level tasks such
      as instruction following there is probably an absence of task
      types that push the model to learn this behavior and to be quite
      frankly from a later RLHF perspective I doubt anyone wants to do a
      full blown Harold bloom literary analysis of the models output to
      give a preference rating so I wouldnt be surprised if this step as
      well beats any sort of literary device capabilities out of the
      model. In short I dont think many people would favor a Joycean
      take on XYZ topic over an accessible and informative wikipedia
      style entry on the matter. Anyway this is all hearsay.</p>
      <p>The more I examine instances of impactful prose e.g.¬†utterances
      packed with intentionality and metaphysical depth and try to
      formally capture their distinctive features, the more convinced I
      become that modeling such language necessitates a type of fluid
      literary intelligence. Ultimately, this exploration leads to
      deeper epistemic questions: what precisely constitutes literary
      novelty, and how can we recognize and evaluate it computationally,
      and lastly are there no benchmarks on par with ARC that touch on
      this axis of intelligence?</p>
      <p>Also, if we had 20 Harold blooms doing RLHF or composing
      benchmarks made up of curated instances of ExO language then I
      truly believe we could optimize models to exhibit this type of
      intelligence. And RL scales if we got from GPT3 to ChatGPT with
      10,000 samples maybe we can just have a handful of Harold Bloom
      for models. Also could this not generalize to other creative tasks
      as well? AND historically I believe reasoning tasks/benchmarks
      have too heavily focused on verifiable tasks such as coding and
      mathematical reasoning.</p>

      <p>Here as some resources on controllable generation these could
      offer a good starting point in terms of guiding models to emulate
      instances or traces of extra-ordinary language they could even
      help showcase whether such latent reprentations even exist for the
      task in these models, but I think to truly address this task there
      will be a need to address deeper epistemic questions, questions
      about creativity, novelty, fluid intelligence, and in machine
      learning terms adaptive generalization to out of distribution
      tasks (hence the Francois Chollet paper).</p>

      <ol type="1">
      <li><p><strong>Refinement:</strong> Can we formally bound the
      space of ExO language? Our current modal framework offers a
      logical sketch but most likely lacks sufficient coverage or the
      rigidity needed for identification, representation and evaluation.
      We need clearer boundaries: When does poetic contradiction become
      noise and what is the true scope of these instances of linguistic
      novelty.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Epistemic Requirements:</strong> What cognitive
      capacities underlie ExO understanding and can models develop
      analogues of them and critically, will this require efforts that
      extend beyond emulation and pattern matching, toward fluid
      intelligence, e.g.¬†adaptive generalization to out of distribution
      tasks. Additionally, what role does ExO language play in the
      broader arc of intelligence? Could it serve as a diagnostic for
      flexible reasoning or abstract linguistic intelligence?</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Can we develop metrics that
      reward semantic dissonance under control e.g.¬†language that
      violates expectations but remains interpretable and meaningful?
      Effective evaluation depends on a rigorous definition of ExO.
      Without clearly defined formal properties semantic, modal, etc we
      cannot design benchmarks that identify interpretive tension,
      modality shifts, or allegorical coherence as measurable
      features.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Generation Control:</strong> How do we tune a model
      along an anomaly-coherence axis and in a more critical sense can
      we capture the generative faculty behind ExO language?</p></li>

      <h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
      <p>It‚Äôs hard not to think of Wittgenstein‚Äôs elucidation of private
      pain or propositions like<br />
      ‚Äúwhat can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot
      talk about we must pass over in silence.‚Äù<br />
      Hand-wavey metaphysical insights aside, maybe we can define these
      extra-ordinary utterances in purely distributional terms.<br />
      The J. L. Austin brute-force approach: <strong>want to understand
      a linguistic phenomenon? Read through countless examples and then
      formalize.</strong></p>
      <p>Ultimately, the hope is to improve generation so we can guide
      it toward extra-ordinary usage, language that is <em>‚Äúwondrous
      strange snow.‚Äù</em></p>
