      Shallow Fusion: Bridging Data Scarcity and AI Integration
      Challenges</h1>
      <p><strong>COLLINS WESTNEDGE</strong><br />
      <em>APRIL 16, 2025</em></p>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>AI adoption and integration have become focal points in
      seemingly every earnings call, linkedin post, townhall and
      industry keynote. However, most of these conversations exist to
      highlight revenue potential, promote products and services, or
      bolster positive consumer sentiment, which is likely why they tend
      to gloss over or abstract away the technical challenges that stand
      in the way of effective adoption. One of the fundamental
      challenges is the gap between available data and the data needed
      for a domain-specific task.</p>
      <p>Consider for example applying a large generalist model to a
      highly specialized task that barely surfaces in its pretraining
      data if at all. For the generalist model to succeed, it must first
      grasp dense company prospectuses, specialized jargon, and the
      nuances of the business problem itself. To address this gap
      companies often resort to standard recipes e.g.¬†‚Äúexciting‚Äù the
      right activations through few-shot examples, dumping streams of
      internal documents into the model‚Äôs context, or ambitious attempts
      at fine-tuning on small internal datasets. However, with these
      approaches there‚Äôs often no optimization signal or gradient to
      move against and progress if there‚Äôs any to be had involves a good
      deal of guesswork, trial, and error.</p>
      <p><strong>Automatic Speech Recongition (ASR)</strong> exemplifies
      this challenge. Many domains, such as medicine, law, financial
      services, etc contain specialized terminology that is typically
      outside the distribution or under-represented in the pretraining
      for general purpose models. A model trained on everyday speech
      will struggle with phrases like ‚Äúothostatic tachycardia‚Äù or domain
      specific acronyms. Traditional solutions to this issue involve
      collecting domain-specific audio and ground truth transcriptions
      (often hand labeled) which can be cost prohibitive. Open source
      datasets on specialized domains are becoming more common but their
      volume and variety remain too limited, keeping them
      out-of-distribution for many business use cases.</p>
      <!-- this would be a good place to talk about the existing community and how others have done shallow fusion as a way to address this problem (not just me) -->
      <p>This distribution gap motivated me to explore the concept of
      <strong>shallow fusion</strong>: combining general-purpose ASR
      model with domain-specific language models during inference.
      Rather than requiring extensive retraining, shallow fusion
      leverages existing domain expertise during inference from an
      external language model. The questions I would like to explore in
      this article are: Can a language model trained on domain-specific
      text meaningfully improve speech-to-text transcription accuracy
      within an adjacent domain? And critically, what are the failure
      modes associated with this type of integration?</p>
      <h2 id="background-existing-approaches">Background &amp; Existing
      Approaches</h2>
      <p>This section is about discussing how the community has used ASR
      to overcome domain mismatch in ASR</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Discuss problems current research has addressed</li>
      <li>Discuss types of fusion, cold, deep, shallow</li>
      <li>Discuss methodologies high level</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="shallow-fusion-explained">Shallow Fusion Explained</h2>
      <p>But first, what is shallow fusion? Consider for example, a
      person listening to audio of a phone call with a customer and
      customer service agent at an insurance claims calls center. The
      sole function of this person is to transcribe what they hear into
      text. The caveat, however, is that they only know very little
      about the domain and the types of technical issues and medical
      terminology e.g.¬†(procedures diagnoses etc) that representatives
      and customers are mentioning. Now consider a second person who has
      worked in this industry for many years and has a deep
      understanding of the domain, but is hard of hearing.</p>
      <p>Shallow fusion can be thought of as a process of integrating
      each person‚Äôs expertise to offset the errors of one another and
      bridge modalities the other does not have access to. With this
      analogy we can now formally describe this process. In the example
      below think of <span class="math inline">\(P_{\text{ASR}}\)</span>
      as the person listening to the audio and <span
      class="math inline">\(P_{\text{LM}}\)</span> as the domain expert
      that is hard of hearing but deeply understands the context.</p>
      <h3 id="mathematical-formulation">Mathematical Formulation</h3>
      <p>At each decoding step for some audio input, we select the most
      probable token <span class="math inline">\(y_{t}\)</span> using
      information from the Automatic Speech Recognition model (ASR) and
      the Language Model (LM)</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      y^* = \arg\max_{y_t}\!\left[
      \log P_{\mathrm{ASR}}(y_t \mid x, y_{&lt;t})
      + \lambda\,\log P_{\mathrm{LM}}(y_t \mid y_{&lt;t})
      \right]
      \]</span></p>
      <p>where:<br />
      - <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the decoding step
      (0-based).<br />
      - <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> is the chosen token at
      step <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(y_{\lt  t}\)</span> are previously generated
      tokens.<br />
      - <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the acoustic
      features (e.g.¬†raw audio input).<br />
      - <span class="math inline">\(P_{\text{ASR}}\)</span> depends on
      both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(y_{\lt  t}\)</span>, while <span
      class="math inline">\(P_{\text{LM}}\)</span> depends on <span
      class="math inline">\(y_{\lt  t}\)</span> only.<br />
      - <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the weighting
      factor to determine the language model‚Äôs influence.</p>
      <p>The idea is that the ASR model understands phonetics and
      language in a general sense while the LM model understands the
      specialized domain in its written form, but has no access to the
      audio signal. Just like in the analogy from earlier by fusing
      their predictions, we combine phonetic understanding with domain
      expertise, leading to more accurate transcriptions for domain
      specific terms. Without careful integration or synergy between the
      two, both models can carry major limitations.</p>

      <p>Consider an example where Whisper serves as our listening
      expert and GTP2 as our domain-language expert. In practice these
      models share a tokenizer making the process of integrating their
      predictions fairly seamless at least for the english version of
      Whisper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04356">Radford
      2.2</a>). Now let‚Äôs consider a claims call center transcript where
      an ASR model misinterprets a specialized medical term.</p>

      </li>
      <li>At the final subword, Whisper may exhibit uncertainty,
      spreading probabilities across candidates: ‚Äúdiploma‚Äù, ‚Äúaroma‚Äù,
      ‚Äúmelanoma‚Äù</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="domain-gpt-2-predictions">2. <strong>Domain GPT-2

      <li><p>‚ÄúThe procedure was medically necessary for the treatment of
      claimant‚Äôs <code>_____</code>‚Äù</p></li>
      <li><p>GPT-2 which as been fine tuned on medical literature
      strongly favors the correct token (produces log probabilities
      closer to 0 for melanoma) while Whisper, which had minimal access
      to medical terminology, assigns it a much lower likelihood (log
      probabilities that are more negative).</p></li>
