    <div>
      <p>Hi, I'm Collins. I work as a Senior Data Scientist. My background is in philosophy, specifically in the philosophy of language, where my studies focused on various phenomena in natural language and the ways in which these phenomena can be formalized. This interest eventually led me to explore probabilistic approaches to language, and in turn the field of data science and machine learning as a whole.</p>
      <p>Anyway, follow me on my journey through data, philosophy, and ML in the pursuit of bending AI to the will of human-kind (hopefully). Also, checkout my articles below and lets connect on Linkedin!</p>

        <h3>🎭 Extra‑Ordinary Language</h3>
        <div class="scroll-pane">
          <p>
            I've been thinking a lot about a chat I had with a former colleague about language that breaks semantic expectations. 
            The conversation then veered into causal language models and their various generation parameters like temperature.
            What interests me in particular is unexpected or anomalous usage with clear intention where semantic violations in the form of absurdities or paradoxes are packed with metaphysical depth.
          </p>
            In this post, I'm dog-earing these thoughts to revisit later. 
            The aim here is to examine the specific forms these expressions take and explore how we might capture their tension and their coherence in a computational framework.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Literary Examples</h4>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              So they lov'd, as love in twain<br>
              Had the essence but in one;<br>
              Two distincts, division none:<br>
              Number there in love was slain.<br><br>
              
              Hearts remote, yet not asunder;<br>
              Distance and no space was seen<br>
              Twixt this Turtle and his queen
            </p>
            <span class="attribution">— Shakespeare, <em>The Phoenix and the Turtle</em></span>
          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              A cage went in search of a bird.
            </p>

          </blockquote>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Merry and tragical! Tedious and brief!<br>
              That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.<br>
              How shall we find the concord of this discord?

          </blockquote>
          
          <h4>Pseudo-Formalizations</h4>
          <p>
            Because of their intentionality and depth I'm going to call these violations of "ordinary use" "extra-ordinary use" (a bit gimmicky).
            They don't obscure meaning but instead elucidate by way of contradiction. Now the question is how to formalize them?

            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18535">TRACE</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13892">Constrained Generation (Ctrl-G)</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
          <p>There's still a good bit of work to be done in identifying how exactly to find or generate these instances and what sort of rubric we'd need to consider examples worthy. Currently
            the formalizations given is likely under-specified, and our descriptions of the metaphysical or allegorical coherence either over-explain the poetic tension or collapse back into banal prose. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It's hard not to think of Wittgenstein's elucidation of private pain or propositions like 
            "what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence."
            Hand-wavey metaphysical insights aside, maybe we can define these extra-ordinary utterances in purely distributional terms. 
            The JL Austin brute force approach: want to understand a linguistic phenomenon? Read through countless examples of it BEFORE you generalize (continental philosophers take note; data before theory). 
          </p>
            Anyway, if we can formalize it and depending on the nature of that formalization maybe we could guide more interesting generations for language models.
            A fully specified formalization could let us tune generation not just by temperature but by an anomaly–coherence trade‑off, opening new creative possibilities 🤷‍♂️.
          </p>

        <h3>🤕 On Bad Conscience</h3>
        <div class="scroll-pane">
          <blockquote>
            <p>At this point I can no longer avoid giving a first, preliminary expression to my own theory on the origin of <em>bad conscience</em>: it is not easy to get a hearing for this hypothesis, and it needs to be pondered, watched, and slept on.</p>
            <p>I look on bad conscience as a serious illness to which man was forced to succumb by the pressure of the most fundamental of all changes which he experienced— that change whereby he finally found himself imprisoned within the confines of society and peace.</p>
            <p>It must have been no different for these semi-animals, happily adapted to the wilderness, war, the wandering life and adventure, than it was for the sea animals when they were forced to either become land animals or perish—at one go, all instincts were devalued and <em>suspended</em>.</p>
            <p>Now they had to walk on their feet and "carry themselves," whereas they had been carried by the water up till then: a terrible heaviness bore down on them. They felt clumsy at performing the simplest task; they no longer had their familiar guide in this new, unknown world—those regulating impulses that had unconsciously led them to safety.</p>
            <p>The poor creatures were reduced to relying on thinking, inference, calculation, and the connecting of cause with effect—in other words, to relying on their <em>consciousness</em>, that most impoverished and error-prone organ! I do not think there has ever been such a feeling of misery on earth, such a leaden discomfort—and meanwhile, the old instincts had not suddenly ceased to make their demands!</p>
