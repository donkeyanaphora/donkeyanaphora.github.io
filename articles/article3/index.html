      <p><strong>COLLINS WESTNEDGE</strong><br />
      <em>JULY 2, 2025</em></p>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôve been thinking about a conversation I had with a former
      colleague about language that defies ordinary usage. More
      specifically expressions that violate the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics">distributional
      hypothesis</a> of language and yet cary high degrees of
      intentionality and depth.</p>
      <p>When Kafka wrote ‚ÄúA cage went in search of a bird,‚Äù he created
      something that on the surface seems impossible and yet expresses a
      profound and insidious truth. Current AI systems, for all their
      linguistic sophistication, rarely produce such language. They
      excel at coherent, informative prose but struggle with the kind of
      intentional violations that define great literature.</p>
      <p>In this post, I‚Äôm dog-earing these thoughts to revisit later.
      The aim here is to understand what makes these expressions work
      and more critically, the implications this has on how we measure
      and evaluate model intelligence.</p>
      <!-- Along the way, I'll attempt some preliminary formalizations and speculate about why current AI systems struggle with this capacity. -->
      <h2 id="literary-examples">Literary Examples</h2>

      <p>So they lov‚Äôd, as love in twain<br />
      Had the essence but in one;<br />
      Two distincts, division none:<br />
      Number there in love was slain.</p>
      <p>Hearts remote, yet not asunder;<br />

      <h2 id="pseudo-formalizations">Pseudo Formalizations</h2>
      <p>Because of their intentionality and depth I‚Äôm going to call
      these violations of ‚Äúordinary use‚Äù <strong>extra-ordinary
      use</strong>. They don‚Äôt obscure meaning but instead elucidate by
      way of contradiction or a violation of expectations. Now, the
      question is what makes them so unique?</p>

      <p>These literary devices can be characterized as utterances whose
      <strong>literal semantic model fails in the physical world yet
      remains interpretable (and often profound) once we flip modality,
      type, or world-knowledge layer</strong>. Essentially, they present
      a <strong>literal semantic failure</strong> in one domain that
      creates insightful or profound resonance in another domain
      (metaphorical, allegorical, or abstract).</p>
      <p>From the examples above <strong>Extra-Ordinary (ExO)</strong>

      <p>This formalization isn‚Äôt a definition of literary novelty or
      creativity. Rather, it‚Äôs an exploratory framework for analyzing
      expressions that deliberately violate ordinary usage. The goal
      isn‚Äôt to reduce literary innovation to logic, but to probe why
      current language models rarely generate such creative or profound
      language spontaneously. Understanding these limitations may inform
      better evaluation methods that emphasize creativity in linguistic
      intelligence</p>
      <h2 id="why-might-current-ai-struggle-here">Why Might Current AI
      Struggle Here?</h2>
      <p>Current language models face several systematic barriers to
      producing ExO language; at this point many of these are my own
      speculation or fan theory than concrete fact, but nevertheless
      here they are:</p>
      <p><strong>Data Scarcity in Pretraining</strong>: Though profound
      literature exists in pretraining corpora (Google Books, etc.),
      it‚Äôs statistically underrepresented. By definition, novel writing
      is rare, and easily-licensed conventional text dominates the
      training mix. Even within Pulizer Prize winning articles/books etc
      the instances of truly profound prose/ExO language (as impactful
      as they may be) are few and far between.</p>
      <p><strong>Objective Mismatch</strong>: From a causal language
      modeling perspective, next token prediction is less about encoding
      the abstract concepts or deep intentionality these examples are
      made up of and more so about emulation of style and prose. At this
      phase models learn to reproduce surface features without encoding
      the abstract concepts that necessarily drive literary innovation.
      Even though large causal models like GPT-3 begin to exhibit some
      few-shot behavior with sufficient examples, it seems unlikely that
      the causal training paradigm alone gets us the reasoning necessary
      for truly novel language.</p>
      <p><strong>Task Absence During Fine-tuning</strong>: When models
      are optimized for instruction following, there‚Äôs likely an absence
      of tasks that push them to not just learn ExO behavior, but more
      importantly exhibit it. The training emphasizes practical
      capabilities over creative linguistic reasoning. Though literary
      analysis and reading comprehension are a big part of this phase
      they are somewhat distinct from the task of exhibiting and
      producing novel prose. In short, there are more analyses of great
      works than great works, and the reading comprehension/literary
      analysis task itself aligns more intuitively with how we quantify
      intelligence in school.</p>
      <p><strong>RLHF Optimization Pressure</strong>: This one is fun to
      think about. From a preference learning perspective, I doubt
      anyone wants to do full-blown Harold Bloom literary analysis to
      rate model outputs. Most annotators would favor accessible,
      Wikipedia-style entries over Joycean explorations of any topic.
      This optimization pressure likely eliminates whatever literary
      capabilities emerge during pretraining.</p>
      <p><strong>The Deeper Issue: Fluid Literary
      Intelligence</strong>:The more I examine instances of impactful
      prose packed with intentionality and metaphysical depth, the more
      convinced I am that modeling such language requires what I‚Äôd call
      fluid literary intelligence. This goes beyond pattern matching
      toward adaptive generalization on out-of-distribution linguistic
      tasks.</p>
      <p><strong>Missing Benchmarks</strong>: This leads to deeper
      questions: What constitutes literary novelty computationally? Why
      are there no benchmarks on par with ARC that touch this axis of
      intelligence? Current reasoning evaluation has heavily favored
      verifiable tasks (coding, math) over creative reasoning.</p>
      <p><strong>There is Hope</strong>: Even if this does require some
      deeper literary understanding, if we had 20 Harold Blooms doing
      RLHF or composing benchmarks of curated ExO instances, I believe
      we could optimize models toward this intelligence. Reinforcement
      learning scales. If we went from GPT-3 to ChatGPT with thousands
      of samples, maybe we need just a handful of literary experts.
      Additionaly, this approach could even generalize to other creative
      domains.</p>
      <!-- This is more of a fan theory at this point but it feels like examples of profound language may have surfaced in the models pretraining google books though by definition of novel writing it is likely under represented, additionally from a causal language model base training perspective this is less about encoding the abstract concepts or deep intentionality these examples are made up of and more so about emulation of style and prose at this point in the training. Sure larger models like GPT-3 especially with sufficient examples of this type of text may begin to exhibit some few shot behavior or ability to encode more abstract concepts about this sort of language, but overall I would be surprised if the casual base training paradigm gets us the level of reasoning and intelligence necessary to truly exhibit novel prose. 

      As the models are further optimized on higher level tasks such as instruction following there is probably an absence of task types that push the model to learn this behavior and to be quite frankly from a later RLHF perspective I doubt anyone wants to do a full blown Harold bloom literary analysis of the models output to give a preference rating so I wouldnt be surprised if this step as well beats any sort of literary device capabilities out of the model. In short I dont think many people would favor a Joycean take on XYZ topic over an accessible and informative wikipedia style entry on the matter. Anyway this is all hearsay. 

      The more I examine instances of impactful prose e.g. utterances packed with intentionality and metaphysical depth and try to formally capture their distinctive features, the more convinced I become that modeling such language necessitates a type of fluid literary intelligence. Ultimately, this exploration leads to deeper epistemic questions: what precisely constitutes literary novelty, and how can we recognize and evaluate it computationally, and lastly are there no benchmarks on par with ARC that touch on this axis of intelligence? 

      Also, if we had 20 Harold blooms doing RLHF or composing benchmarks made up of curated instances of ExO language then I truly believe we could optimize models to exhibit this type of intelligence. And RL scales if we got from GPT3 to ChatGPT with 10,000 samples maybe we can just have a handful of Harold Bloom for models. Also could this not generalize to other creative tasks as well? AND historically I believe reasoning tasks/benchmarks have too heavily focused on verifiable tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning.  -->

      Approaches</h2>
      <p>Here as some resources on controllable generation. These could
      offer a good starting point in terms of guiding models to emulate
      instances or traces of extra-ordinary language they could even
      help showcase whether such latent reprentations even exist within
      the model. However, I think to truly address the difficulty of
      producing ExO language there will be a need to address deeper
      epistemic questions, questions about creativity, novelty, fluid
      intelligence, and in machine learning terms adaptive
      generalization to out-of-distribution tasks (hence the Francois
      Chollet paper).</p>

      <h2 id="open-problems">Open Problems</h2>
      <p><strong>Empirical Approach</strong>: Can we just crank up the
      temperature and RLHF against literary critics? Is the solution as
      simple as generating more varied outputs and having 20 Harold
      Blooms rank them? Or does this require deeper architectural
      changes?</p>
      <p><strong>Rules vs.¬†Intuition</strong>: Do models need to deeply
      formalize the rules of language to meaningfully break them? Or can
      expert preference data teach the patterns directly without
      explicit rule-learning? This gets at whether ExO generation is
      about systematic reasoning or learned aesthetic judgment.</p>
      <p><strong>Sample Efficiency</strong>: How many expert annotations
      would we actually need? If RLHF worked with 10K of samples for
      ChatGPT, maybe we only need hundreds of expert literary judgments
      to see significant improvement in creative output.</p>
      <p><strong>A broken clock is right twice a day</strong>: Is there
      a meaningful difference between ‚Äúturning up randomness and
      filtering with experts‚Äù versus ‚Äúgenuine creative intelligence‚Äù?
      Could high-temperature generation coupled with expert filtering
      approximate the cognitive processes behind ExO language?</p>
      <p><strong>Expert Agreement:</strong> This one is personal because
      I see it all the time in business problems. Would literary critics
      even agree on what constitutes good ExO language? The subjectivity
      of literary judgment might make this approach messier than
      mathematical reasoning tasks. Is Citizen Kane actually one of the
      greatest films of all time or was it just the introduction of
      depth of field that won audiences and the Academy over?</p>
      <p><strong>Generalization Limits</strong>: If we optimize models
      toward specific critic preferences, do we get genuine creative
      capability or just better mimicry of those critics‚Äô tastes? I
      think of Wittgensteins example of mimicry and rule following. A
      pupil is learning a geometric series: The pupil has been tested on
      examples of counting by +2 up to 1000. The pupil is then asked to
      continue the task on numbers above 1000 and then writes 1000,
      1004, 1008, 1012. The pupil claims they have been following the
      rule all along: ‚ÄúUp to 1000 I add 2; from 1000 onward I add 4.‚Äù
      Every step the pupil took in training was perfectly compatible
      with this alternative rule. Most intelligence tasks are about
      fluid and adaptive generalization.</p>
      <!-- "measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience" -->
      <!-- As Wittgenstein states in PI "Must I understand an order before I can act on it? - Certainly, otherwise you wouldn't know what you had to do! - But from knowing to doing is surely a further step!" -->
      <!-- 
      A pupil is learning a geometric series the pupil has been tested on examples up to 1000 then they get the pupil to continue the series (+2) he writes 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012. The pupil claims he has been following the rule all along: ‚ÄúUp to 1000 I add 2; from 1000 onward I add 4.‚Äù Every step he took in training was perfectly compatible with this alternative rule. I think this relates to a deeper question posed by arc dataset and apple paper  -->
      <h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Just because anyone can write poetry doesn‚Äôt mean they should.
      Similarly, just because models can exhibit surprisal or violate
      semantic expectations doesn‚Äôt always mean they possess the ability
      to do so meaningfully. Ultimately, the goal is to understand
      whether machines can develop the kind of flexible, creative
      intelligence that ExO language represents‚Äîand to build evaluation
      frameworks that recognize this intelligence when it emerges. In
      short, we need benchmarks that reward ‚Äúwondrous strange snow.‚Äù</p>
      <!-- 
      Ultimately, the hope is to improve generation so we can guide it toward extra-ordinary usage, language that is *‚Äúwondrous strange snow.‚Äù* -->
